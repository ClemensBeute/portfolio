    These Seashells where made on a vacation in Denmark.
    While wandering in the mud flats, my node brain just couldn't resist :)
    I had to recreate all those beautiful seashells like whelks, common cockles and razor clams in blender.
    Everything is done procedural with Geometry Nodes and Shader Nodes.
