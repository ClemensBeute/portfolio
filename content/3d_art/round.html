<h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">donut</h1>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    This donut with a slightly demonic twist was created in the context of Nodevember 2021 for the round prompt.
    I was inspired by a Geometry Nodes Stream of Erindale.
    Everything is procedural. Created with Geometry Nodes and Shader Nodes in Blender.
