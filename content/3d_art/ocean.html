    This was created in the context of Nodevember 2020 for the fluid prompt.
    Created in blender, only in Shader Nodes by using vector displacement.
    I was always curios, how one could achieve displacement with overhang.
    So with this prompt I saw the opportunity to explore animated vector displacements.
    Not 100% procedural, as I baked out the wave vd animation into an images sequence.
    Then this sequence was placed multiple times randomly with python inside a shader.
    (This was the firts and only time i reached the Shader Node count limit &#128517)
    Not a good solution, now I could think of better ways, but as a proof of concept it worked for me.
