<h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">chocolate cookie</h1>
<p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
    This chocolate cookie was created in the context of Nodevember 2020 for the game prompt.
    It is inspired by a game item icon from world of warcraft.
    Everything is procedural. Created in blender, only in Shader Nodes by using vector displacement.
    It is very interesting what can be achieved with vector displacement using only a basic starting geometry.
    Of curse it is debateable if this is the easiest solution to achieve this outcome,
    but this was meant as an exploration pice to learn vector displacement.
    Also Geometry Nodes wasn't there back then.
