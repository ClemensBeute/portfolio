    This is a blender add-on I created. It provides a brush tool for flow map painting.
    Flow maps are really helpful in shaders, when you need directional information.
    You can use them for example to create a flow like appearance (like water, lava etc).

    The river scene I build with some quixel assets and Geometry Nodes.
    Flow Map Painter was used to paint in the flow of the river.
    As you can see, by painting in some details in the flow map,
    you can direct the water to flow around the rocks.

    Following is a shader exploration.
    It shows that creating flow is not the only application of flow maps.
    This is a fake hair shader. Each hair is composed out of many dots.
    The hair dots are combed into the wanted direction with the flow map painter.
    Afterward some noise is applied to get a animated wind effect.
    So a more fitting naming for those maps would be direction maps.
